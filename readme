* W3C validation notes an error due to use of vendor specific -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio  However, this is needed for expected behavior on iPad Air 2, iPhone 6 and HTC One M8.
* IE not currently supported.  There are issues with the SVG logo graphic and modal sizing.  Only tested IE version 11.0.9600.17842.  Chrome is supported for Windows platforms.
